We use three numbers as "official" Stratio version to ease integration with continuous delivery.
In the final artifact however we put also the upstream toree version. We list below which toree
version each Stratio version uses

* 0.1.0: uses toree 0.2.0.dev1-incubating
* 0.2.0: uses toree 0.3.0-incubating
* 0.3.0: uses toree 0.4.0-incubating
* 0.4.0: uses toree 0.6.0-incubating
